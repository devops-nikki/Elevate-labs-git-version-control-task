## Project Overview
This repository aims to help you learn and implement version control workflows effectively in a DevOps environment. It includes practical examples of Git commands, branching workflows, and automation using GitHub Actions.
---
## Features
- Git branching: main, dev, and feature/* branches
- Use of pull requests (PRs) for merging code
- Semantic versioning with Git tags
- GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI)
- Documentation of Git workflows and commands

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Git installed on your system
- A GitHub account
---
## Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/devops-nikki/Elevate-labs-git-version-control-task.git
cd devops-git-task
```
---
## Branch Usage
- Work on dev branch for ongoing development
- Create feature branches off dev for new features/fixes
- Use pull requests to merge changes to dev and then to main
---
##  Branching Strategy

| Branch       | Purpose                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `main`       | Production-ready code                |
| `dev`        | Integration and ongoing development  |
| `feature/*`  | Feature-specific branches off `dev`  |

- Pull requests are required to merge `feature/*` branches into `dev`, and `dev` into `main`.
---
## Continuous Integration (CI)
This project uses GitHub Actions to automate builds and checks on each push or pull request.

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
