# Task Notes

## Git Best Practices Used:
- Created separate branches: main, dev, feature.
- Used pull requests to merge branches.
- Tagged initial version as `v1.0`.
- Implemented `.gitignore` to avoid unnecessary files.
- Created CI workflow using GitHub Actions.

## Project Setup:
- Used shell script to simulate setup.
- HTML file added in `src/` to simulate front-end source.
